‘Streamline_CorticalMovie5.m’  
creates videos and snapshots showing cortical high-gamma dynamics.

‘Streamline_STEP7_5.m’  
detects significant group-level high-gamma augmentation/attenuation in each ROI  
(approx. 12 minutes total).

‘Streamline_STEP8_CompOff2.m’  
‘Streamline_STEP8_CompOn2.m’  
‘Streamline_STEP8_RespOn2.m’  
identify pairs of ROIs that exhibit significant and simultaneous high-gamma augmentation/attenuation at consecutive five or more time bins  
(each takes approx. 45 minutes).  

‘Streamline_STEP9_1.m’  
identifies tracts stored in the ‘streamline_template’ folder based on the pairs of ROIs identified in STEP8 above  
(approx. 1 minute total).  

‘Streamline_STEP10_1.m’  
adjusts the opacity of white matter tracts in the video  
(approx. 1 minute total).   

‘Streamline_STEP11_4.m’  
creates videos and snapshots of functional connectivity/coactivation network.
